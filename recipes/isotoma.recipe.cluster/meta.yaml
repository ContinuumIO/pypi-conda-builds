    # syntax is module:function.  For example
    #
    # - isotoma.recipe.cluster = isotoma.recipe.cluster:main
    #
    # Would create an entry point called isotoma.recipe.cluster that calls isotoma.recipe.cluster.main()


  # If this is a new build for the same version, increment the build
  # number. If you do not include this key, it defaults to 0.
