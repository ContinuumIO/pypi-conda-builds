build:
  preserve_egg_dir: True
  # entry_points:
    # Put any entry points (scripts to be generated automatically) here. The
    # syntax is module:function.  For example
    #
    # - zc.dict = zc.dict:main
    #
    # Would create an entry point called zc.dict that calls zc.dict.main()


  # If this is a new build for the same version, increment the build
  # number. If you do not include this key, it defaults to 0.

  summary: 'BTree-based persistent dict-like objects (regular dict and ordered) that can be\nused as base classes.\n\nThis is a bit of a heavyweight solution, as every zc.dict.Dict (and\nzc.dict.OrderedDict) is at least 3 persistent objects.  Keep this in\nmind if you intend to create lots and lots of these.\n\nTo build, run ``python bootstrap/bootstrap.py`` and then ``bin/buildout``\nfrom this directory.  A clean, non-system Python is strongly recommended.\n'
