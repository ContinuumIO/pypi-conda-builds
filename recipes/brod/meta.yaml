  summary: "brod lets you produce messages to the Kafka distributed publish/subscribe messaging service. It started as a fork of pykafka (https://github.com/dsully/pykafka), but became a total rewrite as we needed to add many features.\n\nIt's named after Max Brod, Franz Kafka's friend and supporter."
