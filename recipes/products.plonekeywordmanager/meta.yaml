  summary: 'Plone Keyword Manager allows you to change, merge and delete           keywords in Plone and updates all corresponding objects automatically.          It uses a similiarity search to support you in identifying similar keywords.          Keywords can be cleaned up from time to time by a site manager to           create a consistent vocabulary.'
