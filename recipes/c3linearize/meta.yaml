  # entry_points:
    # Put any entry points (scripts to be generated automatically) here. The
    # syntax is module:function.  For example
    #
    # - c3linearize = c3linearize:main
    #
    # Would create an entry point called c3linearize that calls c3linearize.main()


  # If this is a new build for the same version, increment the build
  # number. If you do not include this key, it defaults to 0.

    - c3linearize

  # commands:
    # You can put test commands to be run here.  Use this to test that the
    # entry points work.


  # You can also put a file called run_test.py in the recipe that will be run
  # at test time.
