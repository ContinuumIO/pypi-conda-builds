#  patches:
   # List any patch files here
   # - fix.patch

# build:
  # preserve_egg_dir: True
  # entry_points:
    # Put any entry points (scripts to be generated automatically) here. The
    # syntax is module:function.  For example
    #
    # - input_algorithms = input_algorithms:main
    #
    # Would create an entry point called input_algorithms that calls input_algorithms.main()


  # If this is a new build for the same version, increment the build
  # number. If you do not include this key, it defaults to 0.
  # number: 1

requirements:
  build:
    - python
    - setuptools
    - delfick_error >=1.6

  run:
    - python
    - delfick_error >=1.6

test:
  # Python imports
  imports:
    - input_algorithms

  # commands:
    # You can put test commands to be run here.  Use this to test that the
    # entry points work.


  # You can also put a file called run_test.py in the recipe that will be run
  # at test time.
