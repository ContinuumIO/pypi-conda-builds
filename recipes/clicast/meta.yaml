  summary: 'clicast\n=======\n\nBroadcast messages for CLI tools, such as a warning for critical bug or notification about new features.\n\nQuick Start Tutorial\n====================\n\nAs easy as 1-2-3:\n\n1. Install::\n\n    pip install clicast\n\n2. Create your own cast file and make it accessible as an URL.\n   I.e. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxzheng/clicast/master/test/example.cast ::\n\n    cast "New Message" -f example.cast\n    # See \'cast -h\' for more options to edit cast file\n\n3. Import and call check_message::\n\n    from clicast import check_message\n\n    def main():\n        check_message(\'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxzheng/clicast/master/test/example.cast\',\n                      allow_exit=True,\n                      header=\'=\' * 80,\n                      footer=\'=\' * 80)\n\nCLI Example\n============\n\nDon\'t even want to write the bin script to try? I got you covered! :) ::\n\n    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxzheng/clicast/master/bin/cast-example\n    $ chmod +x cast-example\n\nIf you run cast-example for the first time, you will see::\n\n    $ ./cast-example\n    ================================================================================\n    We found a big bad bug. Please try not to step on it!! Icky...\n    No worries. It will be fixed soon! :)\n\n    Version 0.1 has been released!

Upgrade today to get cool features.\n\n    There is a small bug over there, so watch out!\n    ================================================================================\n    Hello World! Pass in \'-f\' to see message targeted for that option\n\nAnd run it again::\n\n    $ ./cast-example\n    ================================================================================\n    We found a big bad bug. Please try not to step on it!! Icky...\n    No worries. It will be fixed soon! :)\n    ================================================================================\n    Hello World!
