#  patches:
   # List any patch files here
   # - fix.patch

# build:
  # preserve_egg_dir: True
  # entry_points:
    # Put any entry points (scripts to be generated automatically) here. The
    # syntax is module:function.  For example
    #
    # - deterministic_encryption_utils = deterministic_encryption_utils:main
    #
    # Would create an entry point called deterministic_encryption_utils that calls deterministic_encryption_utils.main()


  # If this is a new build for the same version, increment the build
  # number. If you do not include this key, it defaults to 0.
  # number: 1

requirements:
  build:
    - python

    - deterministic_encryption_utils.encryption.extensions

  # commands:
    # You can put test commands to be run here.  Use this to test that the
    # entry points work.


  # You can also put a file called run_test.py in the recipe that will be run
  # at test time.

  # requires:
    # Put any additional test requirements here.  For example
    # - nose
