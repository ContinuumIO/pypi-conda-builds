  summary: 'Reusable Django application that helps you to deliver\nfresh media files, even if their expiry period is really long. To do this,\nthe application provides a template tag that adds a small hash to the URL\nof each served file. This hash depends on the file metadata or content,\nso if it is changed, the hash will be changed too.\n'
