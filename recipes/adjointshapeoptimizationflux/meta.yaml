  entry_points:
    # Put any entry points (scripts to be generated automatically) here. The
    # syntax is module:function.  For example
    #
    # - adjointshapeoptimizationflux = adjointshapeoptimizationflux:main
    #
    # Would create an entry point called adjointshapeoptimizationflux that calls adjointshapeoptimizationflux.main()
