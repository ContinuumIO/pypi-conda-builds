    # Would create an entry point called chemfp that calls chemfp.main()

  summary: 'chemfp is a set of command-lines tools for generating cheminformatics\nfingerprints and searching those fingerprints by Tanimoto similarity,\nas well as a Python library which can be used to build new tools.\n\nThese algorithms are designed for the dense, 100-10,000 bit\nfingerprints which occur in small-molecule/pharmaceutical\nchemisty. The Tanimoto search algorithms are implemented in C for\nperformance and support both threshold and k-nearest searches.\n\nFingerprint generation can be done either by extracting existing\nfingerprint data from an SD file or by using an existing chemistry\ntoolkit. chemfp supports the Python libraries from Open Babel,\nOpenEye, and RDKit toolkits.\n'
