# build:
  # preserve_egg_dir: True
  # entry_points:
    # Put any entry points (scripts to be generated automatically) here. The
    # syntax is module:function.  For example
    #
    # - asymmetricbase.views = asymmetricbase.views:main
    #
    # Would create an entry point called asymmetricbase.views that calls asymmetricbase.views.main()


  # If this is a new build for the same version, increment the build
