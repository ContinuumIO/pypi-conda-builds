  summary: "A SecurityProfile is a way to easily give membership to a set of\ngroups to several users: define your SecurityProfile, say that it\ngives_membership to the CWGroups you're interested in, and link your\nusers to the profile.\n\nThis cube also adds:\n\n* a security_officers CWGroup which has rights to manage\n  SecurityProfiles and the relations used by that entity\n\n* the possibility to map some attributes from an LDAP directory to\n  define which SecurityProfiles a user is linked to\n"
