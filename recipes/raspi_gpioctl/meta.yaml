  entry_points:
    # Put any entry points (scripts to be generated automatically) here. The
    # syntax is module:function.  For example
    #
    # - raspi_gpioctl = raspi_gpioctl:main
    #
    # Would create an entry point called raspi_gpioctl that calls raspi_gpioctl.main()

    - gpioctl            = raspi_gpioctl.cli:main

  # If this is a new build for the same version, increment the build
