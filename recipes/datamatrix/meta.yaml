  summary: "A Pythonic implementation of R's ``data.frame`` structure. This\nmodule allows access to comma- or other delimiter separated files as if they\nwere tables, using a dictionary-like syntax.  ``DataMatrix`` objects can be\nmanipulated, rows and columns added and removed, or even transposed."
