# build:
  # preserve_egg_dir: True
  # entry_points:
    # Put any entry points (scripts to be generated automatically) here. The

    #
    # - neuron = neuron:main
    #
    # Would create an entry point called neuron that calls neuron.main()

  # Python imports
  imports:
    - neuron
    - neuron.tests

  # commands:
    # You can put test commands to be run here.  Use this to test that the
    # entry points work.


  # You can also put a file called run_test.py in the recipe that will be run
  # at test time.
