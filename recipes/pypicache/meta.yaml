  summary: 'The main script provides a relatively painless way to convert a \n    single directory of python packages into an easy_install compatible package\n    archive.  A typical use would be to expose the contents of your\n    PYTHON_EGG_CACHE directory, or your zc.buildout download_cache, to other\n    people or computers on your local area network.'
