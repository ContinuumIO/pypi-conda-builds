    # syntax is module:function.  For example
    #
    # - arduino-sketch = arduino-sketch:main
    #
    # Would create an entry point called arduino-sketch that calls arduino-sketch.main()

    - arduino-sketch=arduino_sketch.app:main

  # If this is a new build for the same version, increment the build
  # number. If you do not include this key, it defaults to 0.
