  entry_points:
    # Put any entry points (scripts to be generated automatically) here. The
    # syntax is module:function.  For example
    #
    # - imreg_dft = imreg_dft:main
    #
    # Would create an entry point called imreg_dft that calls imreg_dft.main()

    - ird = imreg_dft.cli:main

  # If this is a new build for the same version, increment the build
