  summary: "A Twitter bot that polls an RSS feed and posts its entries as tweets, with auto-generated hashtags. For extra mischief, replies to the bot are responded to using a basic Eliza implementation.  After installing, the 'babbler' command will be available which you can use to run the bot. Data will be stored in the current directory."
